# SplitScreener

Standalone app for creating split screen designs for DaVinci Resolve Fusion based on a customizable grid pattern.

## How it works

SplitScreener generates a grid object based on a columns and rows customizable pattern and lets the user create
Screens by clicking and dragging on the graphical representation of the layout.

When the Render button is pressed, the program generates a string that can be interpreted by DaVinci Resolve Fusion
and copies it to the clipboard. When the user pastes it into Fusion, all of the nodes structure they need to
create the actual design will already be there, with values pre calculated and set by SplitScreener.
